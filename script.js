I hope this message finds you well. As a US citizen of Pakistani origin, I deeply value the commitment of Congressmen towards protecting democracy and human rights around the globe. Your recent letter to President Biden, though well-intended, does not fully account for the realities and complexities on ground and misrepresents certain aspects of the situation. 
I believe that facts have been biasedly presented due to the influence of coordinated campaigns by selected members of PTI. Pakistan’s recent elections were conducted under the supervision of international observers, including UN, and were found to meet acceptable standards without any significant concerns of fraud or irregularities. It may be noted that PTI not only won elections in KPK province but also emerged as the largest party in National assembly. Still their choice to reject the elections, is comprehensible as they failed to form the federal govt. 
The letter, focuses on one political party aimed and show a clear bias. In reality, Mr. Imran Khan faces numerous criminal charges, some of which have been validated by lower courts, and his trials are ongoing in accordance with Pakistan's judicial system. I believe it may be premature to portray Mr. Khan's imprisonment as purely politically motivated or as a result of human rights violations without acknowledging the broader legal context.
Moreover, Mr. Khan's divisive political approach, including his failure to foster inclusivity and his rhetoric for civil disobedience, coupled with violent protests incited by his supporters, has resulted in a lot of instability in Pakistan.
Mr. Khan's controversial stances, such as his support for the Taliban during the US military efforts in Afghanistan and his characterization of Osama bin Laden as a "martyr," have caused significant concerns both domestically and internationally (ineligibility for Oxford Chancellorship is a testimonial). Content propagated in articles of different websites cited in your letter may not have fully captured the complexities of the legal cases surrounding Mr. Khan and the broader political environment in Pakistan.
It is important to acknowledge that Pakistan's political landscape is deeply complex. The country faces numerous internal challenges, including terrorism, economic difficulties, and political instability. Any undesirable external pressure on the government may unintentionally exacerbate these issues, making it harder to foster a peaceful and stable democracy. It is essential that the US continues working with all stakeholders in Pakistan, rather than applying pressures which might alienate important partners and destabilize the region further.
I urge you to reconsider your stance, in light of the points I have raised, before making further statements regarding Pakistan’s internal affairs.
Regards`;
